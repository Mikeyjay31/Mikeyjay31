### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Previous coding experience, if any. I have a friend that took Computer Science all throughout highschool, and now attends CCP. He has showed me some of his work and we have talked about it over the summer, and that is all
Reason(s) for taking this class.  I really like the concept of knowing how to write code, and i wanted to one day colaberate with my friend on a project 
Other interests (academic or otherwise). My other interest is baseball.
Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete. I just want to get all of the basics out of the way so i can teach my self more down the road. The ultimate goal is making a very simple side scroller game.
